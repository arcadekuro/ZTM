    "OOP is what we call a **paradigm** - a way for us to think about our code and structure our code so that it is easier to maintain, extend and write. As it gets bigger we are able to be organised. So it doesn't turn into chaos. Code becomes more and more files and code gets complicated because technology is everywhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "i.e. An example would be drove delivery\n",
    "We need to break it up into smaller pieces or objects that represent the real world. For example:\n",
    "* Code an object(our own data type) which is the propelers which allows the drone to fly.\n",
    "* Another developer could code the camera and the vision part of the drone.\n",
    "* Another developer could create the claws to hold the package\n",
    "* And another would create Object for signalling.\n",
    "What we're doing here is breaking up data and functionality into different pieces that model the real world. Seperate objects, so that different people can work on different parts which can then be combined afterwards. \n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty is that when we want  to create a different delivery service we can still use some of the objects from the drone but combine it with new pieces. This extends functionality from our drone into different objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main takeaway is that **OOP is a paradigm, a way to think about to code and structure it, so that as it gets bigger we're able to be organised as the codebase becomes bigger so it doesn't end up with thousands of lines of code**"
