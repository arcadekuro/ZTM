    "We moved from just writing lines of code to something that was more object focused to organise code. \n",
    "Around the same time as **small talk** there was the concept of functional programming paradaigm. \n",
    "\n",
    "**N.B. Remember a paradigm is a way for us to think about and organise our code. **\n",

    "## 133. What is Functional programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "All about seperation of concerns, which OOP does as well - seperating parts of our code into pacakages and each part is organised in a way that makes sense based on functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means each part concerns itself with something that it's good at. Previously in OOP we used classes to divide up different player types. Functional programming has this idea as well of seperating concerns but they also seperate data and functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of combining methods and attribute, we seperate them because they are two seperate things. There's data and this data gets interacted and acted upon. Generally functional programming languages have an emphasis on simplicity where data and functions are concerned because in most functional programming paradigms, we don't have this idea of classes and functions. Instead functions operate on well-defined data structures like lists and dictionaries rather than belonging that data structure to an object. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day however, the goal of a functional programming paradigm is the same as OOP. The idea of making our code clean and understandable, easy to extend(we can grow our cod) and make it better. Easy to maintain. Keeps the code dry so we are not repeating ourselves as well as keeping our code memory efficient because we're not storing information all over the place. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clear & Understandable\n",
    "2. Easy to extend \n",
    "3. Easy to maintain\n",
    "4. Memory efficient \n",
    "5. DRY\n",
    "\n",
    "In functional programming there is one very important pillar. If you want to break things down in functional programming it all comes down to this concept of **pure functions**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pure functions is the idea that there is a seperation betweene data of a program and the behaviour of a program. "
